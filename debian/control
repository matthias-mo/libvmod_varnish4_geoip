Description: VMOD plugin for varnish 4 to set a HTTP header with the GeoIP country
 This varnish vmod looks up the IP address of the client connecting to varnish
 in the GeoIP database and sets the HTTP header field "X-GeoIP" with the ISO
 country code it gets from GeoIP. It further sets the "redirect" flag in the
 same header field as a recommendation for the backend on whether to redirect to
 a country specific page or not.
